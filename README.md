# KPI-Dashboard
Imagine the manager of the IT help-desk department came to you and requested a dashboard that would show how his emloyees have been doing this past month. That is exactly what I did for this project. Here I will walk you through the steps I took to create this dashboard and then if you'd like to see the finished Dashboard on Tableau Public, click [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/anthony.carpinello/viz/KPIDashboard_17250498862910/Dashboard1)!!

This bar chart is showing the average amount calls per day of the week. Notice in the filters section it says "Most Recent Month: True". You will see this filter is applied to most of my sheets. To make this filter, I used the calculated field shown below.

In this image, the 27 is the amount of calls that occured in the most recent day and the 3.896 is the average lenth in minutes of each call.

Here, the 70.47% is the overall resolution rate for all the employees in the past month. To get this number I used a calulated field that divided the total number of resolved calls by the total number of calls.



### Satisfaction Rate
