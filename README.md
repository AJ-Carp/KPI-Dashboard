# KPI-Dashboard
Imagine the manager of the IT help-desk department came to you and requested a dashboard that would show how his emloyees have been doing this past month. That is exactly what I did for this project. Here I will walk you through the steps I took to create this dashboard and then if you'd like to see the finished Dashboard on Tableau Public, click [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/anthony.carpinello/viz/KPIDashboard_17250498862910/Dashboard1)!!


### Call Volume During Week:

This bar chart is showing the average amount calls per day of the week. Notice in the filters section it says "Most Recent Month". This is limiting my graph to only collect data from the most recent month.


### Calls Per Day:

In this image, the 27 is the amount of calls that occured in the most recent day and the 3.896 is the average lenth in minutes of each call.
